// middleware is created to check if a verified logged in user can perform
// actions such as like,comment etc. For e.g. if a user want to like a post:
// 1. He clicks the like button
// 2. auth Middleware checks if he is verified to like the post.
// 3. If he is verified auth middleware (next) method is called 
// which calls the like controller finally.
// refer to posts.js in routes if the code is such that, router.patch('/:id/likePost',auth, likePost),
// we're importing the auth function from here to posts.js and calling it right before likePost function
// so if middlware grants access to like the post it will call next() that will run the next func,
// which is likePost for this case.
